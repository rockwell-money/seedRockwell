[rockwell.money](https://rockwell.money)

This repository contains the seed round smart contract code for Rockwell, a cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that offers a range of investment options to users. The seed round will issue seedRCW tokens, which can be exchanged 1:1 for RCW tokens during the ICO.

### Contract Address
The seed round smart contract is deployed on the following supported chains:

- Ethereum: [0xEeB4cF4B0bAEb9DC2F197e3e75dAa8d7432197Cf](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEeB4cF4B0bAEb9DC2F197e3e75dAa8d7432197Cf "0xEeB4cF4B0bAEb9DC2F197e3e75dAa8d7432197Cf")
- Polygon: [0xEeB4cF4B0bAEb9DC2F197e3e75dAa8d7432197Cf](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xEeB4cF4B0bAEb9DC2F197e3e75dAa8d7432197Cf "0xEeB4cF4B0bAEb9DC2F197e3e75dAa8d7432197Cf")
- BNB Chain: [0xEeB4cF4B0bAEb9DC2F197e3e75dAa8d7432197Cf](https://bscscan.com/address/0xEeB4cF4B0bAEb9DC2F197e3e75dAa8d7432197Cf "0xEeB4cF4B0bAEb9DC2F197e3e75dAa8d7432197Cf")

### Functionality
The seed round smart contract operates as follows:

- The contract mints seedRCW tokens to the user's wallet address upon receiving payment in ETH, MATIC or BNB or USD stable coins.
- The user can exchange their seedRCW tokens for RCW tokens during the ICO, at a 1:1 ratio.
- The funds raised in the seed round will be used for marketing efforts and are non-refundable.

### Usage
To participate in the Rockwell seed round, users can send ETH, MATIC or BNB to the contract address or call the buy() function and provide USD stable coins in exchange. Upon receiving payment, the contract will mint seedRCW tokens to the user's wallet address.

### Disclaimer
This smart contract is provided as-is, and users should perform their own due diligence before participating in the Rockwell seed round.
